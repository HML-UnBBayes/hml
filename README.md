# HML-UnBBayes plugin

The HML-UnBBayes Plugin is an adapter between UnBBayes and the HML core. Basically it includes the standalone tool HML [(Park et al., 2016)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7528144/) inside the already prestigious UnBBayes [(Matsumoto et al., 2011)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.232.681) framework. 
The plugin works as a tool for [UnBBayes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unbbayes/), opening the MEBN's GUI in the end of the HML process to allow the user to work with the MEBN obtained from a relational database using all of UnBBayes' MEBN capabilities.</p>
